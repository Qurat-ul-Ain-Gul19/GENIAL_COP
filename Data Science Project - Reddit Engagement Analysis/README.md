Summary of the Project:

I have to conduct a mini data science investigation using data from 3â€“5 Reddit subreddits accessed through the Reddit API. The goal is to ask an insightful question that can be answered through structured metadata (not full text analysis). 

I'll:

Gather Reddit data (posts and comments)

Store it in a relational SQLite database

Analyse the data using Python

Document my full thought process, including AI tool use

Deliver my work via GitHub in a structured format
